1. Always remember to destructure the data from the parent component.

2. React only re-renders the components that are affected by the changes in the state.

3. Suppose we have an data array & we want to change or update the specific data, always manipulate the state, because if we change the data directly, it will not re-render the component.

4. Any change happens in the state, react will update the component
